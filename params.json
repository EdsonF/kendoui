{"name":"Kendoui","tagline":"Kendo UI widget and utilities code","body":"# KendoUI\r\n\r\nThis GitHub contains a series of Kendo UI widgets and code utilities that I (@OnaBai) have developed.\r\n\r\nSome of the widgets have been developed trying to solve own problems. Others come from questions\r\nthat I receive in my [blog](http://onabai.wordpress.com) and I have considered general enough to\r\ndeserve a public answer.\r\n\r\n## Contains\r\n\r\n### OBButton\r\nConvenience widget that allows you to create a Button (UI) and assign a handler in one single action.\r\n\r\n### OBSortableGrid\r\nEnable a group of DOM elements to be sortable (similar to [jQuery UI sortable](http://jqueryui.com/sortable/)). Implemented as a KendoUI widget.\r\n\r\n### OBPanel\r\nCreate a minimum KendoUI Panel Bar with one single Panel. This is used as a Kendo UI window but being able of limiting its positioning to float only inside a container element and resizing its width to 100% of the container.\r\n\r\n### OBPanelGrid\r\nDefines a container that are one or more columns and each contain one or more KendoOBPanels. OBPanels are draggable between columns allowing users define dynamically a page layout.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
